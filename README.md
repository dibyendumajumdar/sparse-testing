# Tests for Sparse-LLVM backend

The tests in the sub folders are for validating the LLVM backend for Sparse. Each test can be compiled and run.

The tests are sourced from different places - see the notices within each sub-folder.

## Running tests

### Pre-requisites

* LLVM binaries must be on the path. The tests use `lli` command to execute the bitcode generated by Sparse-LLVM.
* Sparse-LLVM must be on the path.
* The test driver is a Python 3.6 script and will not run with Python 2.x.

### Running tests
Note that the test driver is not yet able to handle some of the special cases such as `minilua` test.
To run the tests simply make sure that the pre-requisites are met and then run:

```
python runtests.py
```

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION

The official Sparse-LLVM cannot run these tests yet.
